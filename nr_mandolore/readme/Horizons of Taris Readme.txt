Description
=============================================

The Upper City of Taris at sunset, inspired by both the concepts for Taris as well as the game itself. Initially Darth Norman and I decided to compete mainly against eachother in friendly competition, as we are both MBII devs, though due to time restraints Norman had to sadly drop out :(. Ahh well, here is mine anyway. 

In the future, there might be some bug fixes to the map itself release which will include a Night version of the map as well since I did not have time to complete that for this contest (Due to compile times). This will also be expanded much farther into what you will see in the JKG mods version of the map. Including the lower portions of the city, and many places to explore maybe beyond the city itself.

Features
-This map features a bombardment system to add another level of gameplay as well as a visual element to symbalise what happened to Taris itself. The bombardment happens every 7 minutes, lasting for about 1 minute at a time. During which your FPS might decrease a little due to EFX usage, but it should not cripple anything. If you do not want this feature activated, there are some panels in one of the interior buildings (To the left when facing the landing pad/ship) that allow you to activate and deactivate the bombardment. Keep in mind while playing though, these things do damage!

-City ambience and computer noise ambience when near terminals for greater immersion
-Flyovers by Sith Fighters
-Curved map boundaries to prevent getting stuck when using jetpacks or w/e when using cheats.

Bugs
=============================================

All func_doors do not play a sound when closing. The reason for this, is when you would stand in the door when they could you would get a very loud spamming of the door sound.

Load time is a little longer than it should be (though not bad still) because of the # of patch meshes used on a couple of the buildings. Sorry about that, not much around it though. Est Load time: 30 seconds

Some physical clips on the building ASE models are not 100% accurate due to the angles they are at.
