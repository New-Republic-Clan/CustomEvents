CREDITS
--------
<3 BioWare, whose original inspiration to make these for Knights of the Old Republic prompted me to reproduce them for Jedi Academy. Also thanks to Nozyspy, Kessno, and minilogoguy for beta testing and helping along the way.

--------------------------
INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------
These map objects will need to be extracted and placed in your map_objects folder within your base directory for easiest use while mapping. Remember that these should be included with your PK3 when you release your map, or you may alternatively simply include the original PK3 with your map files.

This package is a mapping utility only! Do not expect it to do anything if you are not a mapper.

DESCRIPTION
------------
I love Knights of the Old Republic. It's a great game, and I think it needs some JA lovin'. However I'm very much anti-ports, so I'm hoping these original models, made from scratch over several weeks, will prompt mappers to take the ball into their own court and produce some excellent replicas using their own work.

Included Models:
-workbench
-computer console
-three storage containers
-kolto tank
-hangar thing from Davik's estate

BUGS
-----
There should not be any bugs with these. If you find some, however, please report them so I can fix them. :)

COMMENTS
---------
I hope that any mappers making KotOR-themed maps will consider using these map objects in their map. I'm also willing to make others, as well as texture replicas.

Also ignore the lighting in the screenshots. I'm not a mapper. ;)
