Abilities:

GarDaren is from Oktaro. A Talented sniper and resourceful Guerilla fighter. When the Empire returned to Oktaro, beliving them to be their liberators of yore, they were welcomed with open arms. 

As with many Oktaros, GarDaren soon realised that the Empire had come to occupy their home planet and steal their resources. GarDaren soon began to organise small
Militia attacks on the Imperial mining operations, during a failed attack, GarDaren and his Militia were all captured. All but 3 of his compatriots were executed and they managed to escape Oktaro, joining the Allience and vowing to avenge 
their fallen friends."
