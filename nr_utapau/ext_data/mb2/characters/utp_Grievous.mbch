Grievous was the Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies of the Confederacy of Independent Systems for most of the Clone Wars.
Born a Kaleesh, Grievous was transformed into a cyborg after a shuttle crash, a fusion of a Krath war droid's powerful robotic structure and his own organic brain, nervous system, and sensory organs. Brilliant golden eyes with black, reptilian pupils and red-raw sockets were the only visible reminder of his organic past as a Kaleesh warlord.
After being recruited by San Hill, he became head of the CIS military. As the commander, Grievous led the Confederacy to victory over the Republic in dozens of battles. He personally ordered the death of billions, causing citizens across the galaxy to fear the merciless general."
