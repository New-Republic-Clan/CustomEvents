Clone jet troopers, or aerial clone troopers, were clone troopers equipped with and trained in the use of jetpacks.

They utilized their limited flight jetpacks to rapidly cover great distances and gain aerial advantage over their enemies.
The agility of the flying jet trooper made them difficult to hit, although their armour was usually weaker than most clone troopers'."
